## ðŸŒ± Random Forest Hyperspectral Image Classification

#### A lightweight script for performing supervised classification on hyperspectral images using a Random Forest classifier.
#### Designed for research or applied remote sensing tasks involving vegetation, soil, or land use mapping.


### ðŸ“¦ Research Information
#### This code is part of a software toolkit for ecological and environmental element extraction, specifically serving as the fine-scale vegetation classification module. It uses a Random Forest algorithm to classify hyperspectral imagery, ultimately generating thematic vegetation classification maps.

#### The classification approach and algorithmic design can be found in the following publication: https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jag.2021.102398


### ðŸ§  Requirements
#### Python 3.8 + 
#### Libraries: numpy, pandas, rasterio, scikit-learn, matplotlib
